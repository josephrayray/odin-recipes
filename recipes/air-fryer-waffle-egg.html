        Sweet and savory air fried waffle and egg
    </h2>

    <h3>
        Ingredients:
    </h3>

        <ul>
            <li>1 frozen waffle</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons shredded cheese</li>
            <li>maple syrup to taste</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>
        Directions:
    </h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Step 1</strong> <p>Preheat the air fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</p></li>
            <li><strong>Step 2</strong> <p>Cut a hole in the center of the frozen waffle using the rim of a cup or glass (about 2 to 3 inches in diameter). Move waffle to a square of parchment paper, then carefully place the parchment paper into the preheated air fryer, along with the small center waffle. </p></li>
            <li><strong>Step 3</strong> <p>Crack egg directly into the center of waffle hole; season with salt and pepper to taste. Close the lid and cook until the white of the egg has started to set, about 5 to 6 minutes.</p></li>
            <li><strong>Step 4</strong> <p>Remove small center waffle from the air fryer. Sprinkle shredded cheese onto egg waffle, and cook until the cheese is melted and egg white is completely set, about 1 to 2 minutes.</p></li>
            <li><strong>Step 5</strong> <p>Transfer egg waffle onto a plate; drizzle with maple syrup and serve immediately.</p></li>
        </ol>
